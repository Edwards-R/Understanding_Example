# A practical guide to Understandings
Understandings are part of a new way of handling biological nomenclature. Their purpose is to solve a deep-seated problem in the 'classical' taxonomic manner in which nomenclature is currently handled. The problem is best explained by an example - hence this document.

>In software engineer's terms, the current system operates in second normal form, in multiple places. Understandings are ***strictly*** third normal form, but only part of the rework. The other part of the rework handles defining 'types' cleanly as an object, but that will require greater buy-in from the scientific community.

## Nomenclature vs Taxonomy
A core portion of Understandings is the separation of concerns between Nomenclature and Taxonomy. A ***very*** simplified explanation of the differences is given below.

>If, at any time, you find yourself thinking '*yes, but that's just a type*', stop and revisit this section. 

### Taxonomy
Identifying groups of organisms, at a given level, that are the same and grouping them

## Nomenclature
Ensuring that it is always possible to track a used name back the modern interpretation of its meaning.

Another, perhaps better, way of looking at Nomenclature is that it is concerned with ensuring that names can accurately be linked to the type(s) that they are thought to reference under modern understandings - no matter how old the name.

## Materials required

- A copy of the BWARS Public database (included)
- A program to open SQLite files, run queries, and view results.
- If you want to follow along, a **very** basic understanding of how to use DB Browser. If you know where to paste a query and what button to press to run it, that's enough.

>This guide has been written using DB Browser, which can be found at https://sqlitebrowser.org/
